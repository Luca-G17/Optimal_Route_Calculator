# Sailing Yacht Optimal Route Calculator
This program uses pathfinding algorithms to find the optimal route between two points on the sea, it then reduces that set of hundreds of points by keeping only the points that the boat will have to make a turn at. Using the plot button will overlay the tacking route that the boat might want to take given the current wind direction.
